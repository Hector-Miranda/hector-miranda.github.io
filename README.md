Complete professional experience and credentials are listed in my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hectormmiranda/).
You won't find a lot in my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Hector-Miranda) because the contributions were made to private repositories.

Early in career I worked as a consultant for several companies, using a variety of stacks and with customers in very different industries.
Nowadays, I am a FTE at Microsoft working on (internal) tools for other developers.

# You Are Not Your Job

If I were good enough, I'd like to draw.
Sadly, I'm _really_ bad at it and cannot seem to find the time to improve.
In that regard, find below some artists I admire:

- [Litterbox Comics](https://www.litterboxcomics.com/)
- [they can talk](https://theycantalk.com/)
- [Sarah Andersen](https://sarahcandersen.com/)
- [War and Peas](https://warandpeas.com/)
- [Hannah Hillam](https://hannahhillam.com/)
- [Simz](https://linktr.ee/simz.art)

(Needless to say, it's not an exhaustive list.)
